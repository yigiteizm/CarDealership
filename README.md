# Car Dealership Application Project

## Description of the Car Dealership Project

The Car Dealership project is a basic Java program made for managing the stock of a car dealership.
It gives users an easy way to add new cars, remove cars, look at all available vehicles, and search by brand, like Chevrolet. 
The program uses a CSV file to keep the car data, making it simple to update and find vehicle records.
 Users can also follow these steps:

1. Searching for Vehicles by Type
2. Listing All Vehicles in the Inventory
3. Adding a New Vehicle to the Inventory
4. Removing a Vehicle from the Inventory
5. Searching for Vehicles Within a Price Range
6. Searching for Vehicles by Year
7. Searching for Vehicles by Color
8. Searching for Vehicles by Mileage Range
9. Searching for Vehicles by Type
